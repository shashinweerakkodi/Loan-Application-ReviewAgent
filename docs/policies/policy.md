# Lending Policy (Sample)

## KYC Requirements
All applicants must have KYC status **Verified** before approval. Applications with **Pending** or **Rejected** KYC must be rejected or manually resolved.

## AML Flags
If AML screening returns a positive risk signal or a watchlist match, the application must be **rejected** pending enhanced due diligence.

## Credit Score Thresholds
Credit scores below **600** indicate elevated risk. Such cases require additional review or stronger compensating factors.

## Debt-to-Income (DTI)
A DTI above **45%** suggests affordability concerns. Applications with high DTI should be **flagged** for manual assessment unless strong mitigating evidence exists.

## Delinquency History
Two or more delinquencies in the past 12 months indicate a high likelihood of repayment issues. Such cases should be **flagged** or **rejected** depending on overall profile.

## Affordability (Requested Amount vs Income)
Requested loan amounts that materially exceed affordability benchmarks should be **flagged**. Consider income, obligations, and purpose.

## Exceptions
Exception handling requires manual approval by a senior credit officer with documented rationale.
